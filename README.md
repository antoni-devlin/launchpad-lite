# Launchpad Lite
Small ruby utility to quickly build a folder structure for (very) simple web development, and create an html skeleton.
*I've written the "lite" version first becuase I could do it quicker. I'll release the full version when I can figure out how to make it as customizable as I want it to be!*

### What do?
Does what is says on the tin really. Run *ruby launchpad-lite* and the program will create the following folder structure:

**Template Project**

--**HTML**

----index.html

--**CSS**

----style.css

--**JS**

----script.js

--**Images**

### TODO
- [x] DRY up needlessly verbose code written during prototyping

- [x]
